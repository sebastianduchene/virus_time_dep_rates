### Main ideas:

- [ ] Is there any time-dependency in rate estimates for viruses? Can we quantify it for some key viruses?
- [ ] Does [BEAST](https://holtlab.net/sebastian-duchene/) over-estimate evolutionary rates?
- [ ] How influential is the prior distribution on rate estimates?
- [ ] Extra -- does the tree (coalescent) prior matter?
